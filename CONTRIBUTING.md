Ergo is an open source project and we love contributions!

There are [many open issues](https://github.com/oughtinc/ergo/projects/1), including plenty that are [good for newcomers](https://github.com/oughtinc/ergo/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

Before you start implementation, please make a new issue or comment on an existing one to let us know what you're planning to do (so we can avoid duplicated work). You can also ping us at ergo@ought.org.

## I want to contribute to notebooks using Ergo

You can help the Ergo project by:

1. Making your own innovative Colab/Jupyter Notebook using Ergo
2. Improving one of our [existing notebooks](/notebooks)

If you'd like to improve one of our existing notebooks or submit your own notebook for inclusion in this repo, please follow [these instructions](https://ergo.ought.org/nbs_contrib.html).

Even if you'd just like to make your own notebook, we'd love to see it!

You can share it with us at ergo@ought.org.
