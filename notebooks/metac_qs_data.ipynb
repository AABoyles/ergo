    "1. `anon_prediction_count` is the closest thing I could find to a count of number of predictions, but I'm not really sure how it relates to the number of predictions. In my testing:\n",
    "    1. It seems to always be the same as the length of `prediction_timeseries`\n",
    "    2. It seems to be correlated with something about the number of predictions shown. E.g.\n",
    "        1. it's 101 for this question where the community prediction is shown: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3530/how-many-people-will-die-as-a-result-of-the-2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-before-2021/.\n",
    "        2. While it's 0 for this question where the community prediction is not shown yet: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4614/when-will-directly-removing-carbon-dioxide-from-the-atmosphere-be-economically-feasible/ \n",
    "    3. I couldn't get it to increment. I tried:\n",
    "        1. making a new prediction with an account that had already predicted on the question\n",
    "        2. making a prediction with an account that had never predicted on that question before.\n",
    "2.`last_activity_time` seems like the most obvious easy proxy for when the most recent prediction was made. However, I'm not sure how reliable it is.\n",
    "    1. It did not update when I made a new prediction from an account that had already predicted on the question previously\n",
    "    2. It may update when people leave comments or at other times\n",
    "    3. Alternatively, we could use the last time from the `prediction_timeseries`, but that also doesn't seem to update every time someone makes a prediction\n",
    "3. To get the datetime of the last posted comment, I think we'd need to retrieve it from a separate API (prob at least 30 min of work, maybe more like hours), so I haven't tried"
