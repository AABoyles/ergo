# Ergo

A Python library for forecasting models

## Working on this repo
1. Format code according to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). I use autopep8 (via VS Code)
2. Run mypy on code: `mypy .`. There should be 0 errors or warnings, you should get `Success: no issues found`
3. Test the code: `pytest`. All tests should pass.
